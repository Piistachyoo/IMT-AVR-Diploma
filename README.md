# IMT AVR Diploma

In this repo, I will upload all my drivers/codes that I wrote while taking the AVR Diploma with **IMT**

This project was created and developed in eclipse IDE and can be imported to your eclipse IDE to build and execute

Note: Drivers are written in the way I see it's easy to use and efficient -it's somehow different than what we wrote with the instructor-, if you have any comment or found any error please contact me!


## Files

 - **Application:** Contains different applications with drivers, you can uncomment the main function to run it (make sure you have only one main function)
 - **HAL:** Hardware architecture layer: contains software related to any on-board hardware element
 - **MCAL:** Microcontroller architecture layer: contains software related to any peripheral inside the microcontroller
 - **Proteus:** Contains proteus projects
 - **Services:** Contains my data types and some bit math operations
